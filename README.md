# Plotly Deployment

Improbable Beef is attempting to create a synthetic replacement for beef. Roza is attempting to identify a bacteria that can be implanted in the synthetic beef so that it smells like beef. If Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

Created an HTML/Javascript page that displays a customized dashboard with a bar, bubble and gauge chart designed to identify different types of bacteria based on the voluteer's ID chosen by the user. 
The dashboard is filtered by static data containing ID's in a drop down menu. The gauge provides a visualization identifying the top 10 bacterial species in the volunteer's belly buttons.
